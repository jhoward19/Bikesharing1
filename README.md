# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike Data 

## Overview 
This Tableau story can be seen in its entirety at this link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessica.howard/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16422858933770/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis


The premise of this project was to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to develop a bikeshare startup in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis provides insights on a few key points like:

  *	Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders 
  * Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week 
  * Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week


## Results

In the above image, we can see that more than ¾ of the users are subscribers, who uses the bikes on a regular basis which will be linked to source of income for the startup. In addition, the users are predominantly male, ¼ are females and the other portion remaining is unknown.

In the map above, it displays the bikes stations from which recorded bike trips started. The size of the circle and how dark the circle is, indicates the relative number of trips started at those locations. The map shows that majority of the trips originate from the commercial area of Manhattan, known for the financial district, fashion district, restaurants and plenty of entertainment venues. Bike usage is lower is the surrounding neighborhoods where it’s more residential potentially.

In the first line chart above it shows the number of bikes checked out by all users during their first-time rides then it tampers offs for additional rides. In the second line chart it provides insight by gender and as you can see majority of bikes are checked out by male riders. In both chart shows that majority of bikes are checked out and ride for less than hour.

This bar graph shows two important key points to this startup. It first shows the peak hours of when the bikes are used. You can infer that the peak usage is during the morning rush hours and end of the workday commute times. Secondly, it shows the low usage time from 2am-5am where bikes can be taken offline for maintenance.

This stepped level heatmap show the range of specific bikes that are highly used, and bikes are that not used as much. If you hover over any part of the heatmap you can see how much a specific bike is used. The red into orange indicates the bikes with high mileage on it and the darker green shows the bikes with less mileage on it that would less like need repairs often.

 In the first heatmap it depicts the number of trips per hour by weekday. It shows similar results just like the bar graph. One can assume that peak hours per trips during the weekday is morning rush hour and end of the workday commute. It also shows that Saturday between 9am-8pm is another day where there are more people using the bikes. In the second heatmap, it displays number of trips per hour, by weekday, by gender. Once again, this map is like the previous diagrams that shows that there are more male users during the weekday and weekends.

This heatmap shows that there are number of customers vs subscribers during the week. There is a significant amount of subscribers during the week than customers, showing a potential profit during any day of the week. In addition, there are more male subscribers than female or unknown subscribers which was depicted in the customer description. 

## Summary 
In conclusion, the bikeshare services are popular in congested area where parking is hard like NYC but mainly around commercial real estate that offers various entertainment or a busy job market.  In addition, the users are predominantly male subscribers that could be a reliable population to generate revenue. If I were to provide additional inquires, I would explore more about the ending location during peak hours and evening commutes to get a better understanding of how or why the bikes are being used. Also, explore the female and unknown gender population as why they are less user in order to increase that population usage.
